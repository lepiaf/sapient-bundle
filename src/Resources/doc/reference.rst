Above, you have full configuration reference.

.. sign:
sign
----

Enable signing response. If `sign` key is present, it must contain `public`, `private` and `name` property.
If not present, feature is disabled.

.. sign.public:
sign.public
-----------

Required if `sign` key is present.

It is signing public key string. It is generated by `\\ParagonIE\\Sapient\\CryptographyKeys\\SigningSecretKey::generate()` function.

.. sign.private:
sign.private
-----------

Required if `sign` key is present.

It is signing private key string. It is generated by `\\ParagonIE\\Sapient\\CryptographyKeys\\SigningSecretKey::generate()` function.
This key **must never** be revealed. If it is leaked, you must regenerate a new key pair.

.. sign.name:
sign.name
---------

Required if `sign` key is present.

Name of who sign response. It is required if client want to verifying signature in response.

.. seal:
seal
----

Enable sealing response. Sealing mean that response content is encrypted. Only receiver
with sealing private key can decrypt and reveal response content in clear. If `seal` key is present,
it must contain `public`, `private` and `name` property. If not present, feature is disabled.

.. seal.public:
seal.public
-----------

Required if `seal` key is present.

It is sealing public key string. It is generated by `\\ParagonIE\\Sapient\\CryptographyKeys\\SealingSecretKey::generate()` function.

.. seal.private:
seal.private
-----------

Required if `sign` key is present.

It is sealing private key string. It is generated by `\\ParagonIE\\Sapient\\CryptographyKeys\\SealingSecretKey::generate()` function.
This key **must never** be revealed. If it is leaked, you must regenerate a new key pair.

.. guzzle_middleware:
guzzle_middleware
-----------------

This bundle contain Guzzle middleware to decrypt and verify response.

.. guzzle_middleware.unseal:
guzzle_middleware.unseal
------------------------

If enable, it will activate Guzzle middleware that decrypt response. By default it is disabled.

.. guzzle_middleware.verify:
guzzle_middleware.verify
------------------------

If enable, it will activate Guzzle middleware that verify signature in response. By default it is disabled.

Before enabling this option, you must configure verifying_public_keys_ array.

.. guzzle_middleware.requester_name:
guzzle_middleware.requester_name
------------------------

This Guzzle middleware will add a header ``Sapient-Requester`` automatically on each request. This
header is used by recipient to choose the right key to encrypt response.

It is optional but highly recommended. If not enable, you must add header manually in
Guzzle client configuration.

.. guzzle_middleware.sign_request:
guzzle_middleware.sign_request
------------------------------

If enable, it will activate Guzzle middleware that sign all request. By default it is disabled.

.. sealing_public_keys:
sealing_public_keys
-------------------

List of all **sealing public keys** used to encrypt response. Your client must give you the value in `sapient.seal.public`.
Each item must contain a `key` and a `name`. `name` must match header value `Sapient-Signer`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    sapient:
        sealing_public_keys:
            -
                name: "client-bob"
                key: "sealing public key of client-bob"


.. verifying_public_keys:
verifying_public_keys
-------------------

List of all **verifying public keys** used to verify response. Your api must give you the value in `sapient.sign.public`.
Each item must contain a `key` and a `name`. `name` must match header value `Sapient-Requester`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    sapient:
        verifying_public_keys:
            -
                name: "api-alice"
                key: "verifying public key of api-alice"

.. verify_request:
verify_request
--------------

Each request received by HttpKernel will enter in subscriber that verify signature. It
check ``Sapient-Requester`` header and fetch the public key in **verifying public keys** array.
If found, then it verify signature. If signature is invalid, an ``InvalidMessageException`` is raised.
